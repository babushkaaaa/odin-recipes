        <h3>What is Gnocchi?</h3>
            <p>Gnocchi (singular gnocco) are Italian dumplings made with flour, eggs, and potatoes. Gnocchi can be served in tomato sauce, tossed with pesto, or saut√©ed with butter and herbs.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 potatoes, peeled</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash with a fork or potato masher.</li>
                <li>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour, and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.</li>
            </ol>
