        <h5>Pepperoni rolls</h5>
        <h3>What are Pepperoni rolls?</h3>
            <p>As the name suggests, pepperoni rolls are cottony white dinner rolls baked with pepperoni inside. One pepperoni roll makes an ideal snack; two, a satisfying lunch.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
                <li>1 (.25-ounce) package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
                <li>3 1/2 cups (451g) all-purpose flour, divided, plus more if needed</li>
                <li>8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter, divided</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
                <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>8 to 9 ounces (about 144 slices) thinly sliced pepperoni</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>n a small bowl, place 1/4 cup warm water and sprinkle the yeast over it. Let it sit until dissolved and creamy, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, combine 3 cups (387g) flour and salt.</li>
                <li>In a small saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in the honey and buttermilk, and heat just until warm to the touch (do not boil). Remove from heat and whisk in the egg.</li>
                <li>Add the water and yeast mixture to the flour, along with the buttermilk mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon until the dough just comes together. At first it will be quite sticky. If needed, add the remaining 1/2 cup (64g) flour, bit by bit. Resist the temptation to add a lot of flour; you want a soft dough that’s still kneadable.</li>
                <li>Take a piece of dough and pat it into a square roughly 4 to 5 inches across. Imperfection is totally acceptable here, and in fact slightly preferable. Shingle the pepperoni slices over the square, leaving a 1/4-inch border around the dough. Roll up the dough and firmly pinch the bottom seam to seal. Place it seam-side-down on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. You’ll wind up with 6 rolls per sheet. Brush the rolls with half of the melted butter. Cover each baking sheet with a clean dish towel and let rise for 30 minutes. The rolls will not puff up visibly.</li>
                <li>Bake until lightly browned, 30 to 40 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to bottom and back to front halfway through baking. Immediately after removing from the oven, brush with the remaining butter—you may need to rewarm the butter slightly before brushing. </li>
            </ol>
